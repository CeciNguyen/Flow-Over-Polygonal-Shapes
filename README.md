# Fluid Flow Over Polygonal Shapes: A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Study

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on investigating fluid flow characteristics over polygonal shapes using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This repository contains all the necessary resources, including code, data, and documentation, to replicate and extend our research findings.

## Overview:
Fluid flow around geometric shapes is a fundamental problem in fluid dynamics with numerous applications in engineering and physics. In this project, we delve into the intricacies of flow behavior over polygonal shapes, aiming to analyze phenomena such as flow separation, vortex shedding, and drag forces in comparison to a cylinder. Our investigation spans various polygon sizes, ranging from 4 sides to 32 sides, with a focus on maintaining a consistent Reynolds number of 110 across all cases.
